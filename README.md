# Sidney's Website

By [Sidney Pham](https://github.com/sidneypham/)



## Description

**Sidney's Website** is a **dumb** website created for absolutely no reason. 

Most of it doesn't work, and is pretty **dumb**.



## Installation

### Install dependencies

You know how...

Still reading?!

Fine. But you knew this..

```js
npm install
```



## Configuration

Uhhhhhhh. Everything's running on port 8000. To configure this, just go to /app.js and change these lines:
```js
app.listen([your-port-here], function() {
    console.log("Running on port [your-port-here].");
});
```



## Usage

You know how to run this..

Actually, assuming `npm install` worked, you can actually run it using:

```js
nodemon app.js
```

or be mainstream and just:

```js
node app.js
```

Hmph..
